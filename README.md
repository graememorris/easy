## turns web browsers into creative tools - to create and edit your own files.

web browsers are increasingly powerful programs that can play music and video files, display 2d and 3d vector graphics, and read/play streams of data.
this program consists of a simple server, written in C, which others will hopefully be able to read and understand, and some htm/javascript files that interact with the server.
the main goal of this program is to be simple.
hence the name!

it should be easy for anyone to clone this code, build it and edit it on their own computer, and make an audio or AV player - an SVG editor - a database front end for Sqlite or berkeley db - whatever they want.
to help anyone who comes across it to see what i mean by that, i begin the project with nothing but this readme file.
the first branch will contain the server, and sufficient HTML to make a simple audio player...
